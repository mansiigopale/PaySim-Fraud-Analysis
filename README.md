## Project Overview

This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent mobile money transactions using the **PaySim dataset**, which simulates real-world financial transaction behavior.

Fraud detection is a critical financial security problem where:

- Fraud cases are extremely rare (highly imbalanced dataset)
- Missing a fraud (False Negative) leads to direct financial loss
- High false positives harm customer experience
- Accuracy alone is misleading

This project focuses on **cost-sensitive learning**, **class imbalance handling**, and **business-driven evaluation metrics**.

---

## Business Problem

Digital payment platforms process millions of transactions daily. Even a small fraud detection failure rate can lead to significant losses.

The goal is to:

- Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
- Minimize False Negatives (avoid financial loss)
- Maintain reasonable False Positives (avoid customer friction)
- Use evaluation metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets

---

## Dataset Information

**Dataset:** PaySim Mobile Money Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)

PaySim is a synthetic dataset generated using real-world mobile money transaction patterns.

- ~6.3 million transactions
- 11 features
- Transaction types include:
  - CASH_IN
  - CASH_OUT
  - TRANSFER
  - PAYMENT
  - DEBIT

Target variable:

- `0` → Legitimate
- `1` → Fraud

### Key Features

- `type` → Transaction type  
- `amount` → Transaction amount  
- `oldbalanceOrg` → Sender balance before transaction  
- `newbalanceOrig` → Sender balance after transaction  
- `oldbalanceDest` → Receiver balance before transaction  
- `newbalanceDest` → Receiver balance after transaction  
- `isFraud` → Fraud label (Target)  
- `isFlaggedFraud` → System flagged fraud indicator  

---

## Class Imbalance Challenge

Fraud transactions represent a very small percentage of the dataset, making it a **highly imbalanced classification problem**.

This imbalance causes models to become biased toward predicting legitimate transactions.

---

## Why Accuracy is Misleading

If a model predicts all transactions as legitimate:

- Accuracy will still be extremely high
- Fraud detection rate = 0%

Therefore, this project evaluates models using:

- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- PR-AUC (preferred for imbalanced data)
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Checked for missing values
- Encoded categorical feature `type`
- Standardized `amount` feature using StandardScaler
- Stratified train-test split
- Feature engineering (balance difference errors)
- Ensured no data leakage

---

### 2️. Handling Class Imbalance

Multiple techniques were implemented and compared:

- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Random UnderSampling
- Class Weight adjustment
- Threshold tuning (custom decision threshold)
- Precision-Recall curve optimization

---

### 3️. Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression (with class_weight)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Isolation Forest (Anomaly Detection approach)

---

## Model Evaluation Strategy

Primary optimization focus:

> Maximize Recall (Fraud class) while maintaining acceptable Precision.

Key Metrics:

- Confusion Matrix
- Recall (Fraud Detection Rate)
- Precision
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- PR-AUC Score

---

## Best Model Performance

Best performing model:

**XGBoost with SMOTE + Threshold Tuning**

- ROC-AUC: ~0.98+
- High Recall for Fraud class
- Balanced Precision-Recall tradeoff
- Reduced False Negatives significantly

---

## Business Impact Perspective

In real-world systems:

- False Negative (FN) → Direct financial loss
- False Positive (FP) → Customer dissatisfaction & operational cost

This project prioritizes reducing False Negatives while controlling False Positives to maintain business balance.
